# PFE Scheduling System

A comprehensive system for managing Final Year Project (PFE) presentations, jury assignments, and scheduling.

## Features

- User authentication with role-based access control (Admin, Department Head, Teacher, Student)
- Department management
- Teacher profiles and availability management
- PFE topic submission and management
- Jury assignment with validation of constraints
- Scheduling of presentations
- Real-time updates and notifications

## Project Structure

The project consists of two main parts:
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn-ui components
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express, MongoDB, and JWT authentication

## Prerequisites

Before setting up this project, make sure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- MongoDB (local installation or MongoDB Atlas account)
- Git (optional, for cloning the repository)

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd pfe-scheduling-system
```

### Step 2: Set Up the Backend

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
```bash
cd backend
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file based on the provided `.env.example`:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

4. Update the `.env` file with your MongoDB connection string and JWT secret:
```
PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/pfe-scheduling
JWT_SECRET=your_secure_jwt_secret_key
JWT_EXPIRE=30d
```

5. Start the backend server:
```bash
# Development mode with auto-reload
npm run dev

# Production mode
npm start
```

The backend API should now be running at http://localhost:5000.

### Step 3: Set Up the Frontend

1. Open a new terminal and navigate to the project root directory.

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the frontend development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The frontend application should now be running at http://localhost:5173.
